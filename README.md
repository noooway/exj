Exj is intended to simplify maintenance of a workout journal.

Below are several screenshots of the current prototype version:

Exj is not bound to any particular sports or activity and tries to be 
flexible enough to serve as a substitute for the pen and paper, yet providing
some additional conveniences and automation.

With the current version of the program it should be possible to store
a sequence of training sessions and exercises performed. Besides, the 
functionality should be sufficient for creating and following simple
cyclic training programs.

Common gym exercises are supported out of the box, other types can be added if necessary.

JSON file format is used to store the exercise journal on a disk. 
This allows to easily convert it to other formats if necessary.
